Titanic disaster classification problem (from Kaggle)
=====================================================

The goal in that Kaggle competition is to predict whether a passanger on the Titanic survived the accident ot not.
Both train and test sets are provided, but the actual class label is added to the test se as well for easier evaluation (but, ofcource is ignored in the submissions).

Here are some cool visualization plots of the data (generated by the Matplotlib Python packge). The plots visualize the distribution of the passengers who survived and grouped by their gender. It is clear that larger percentage of feamle passenger had survived the accident.
